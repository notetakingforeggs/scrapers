# branch 2

this has been a nightmare trying to set up this app on python anywhere.

mainly trying to facilitate a log in with the browser as headless, but passing the qr code to the user and continuing the automation at the same time


currently not working, trying to figure out some way in which having logged in on the first automation script, i can then move into the update route and have the log in saved in  user data or something so that i dont have to scan a QR again.

tbh thinking about it now i could just combine the whatsapp scraping and qr retrieval code togehter so that it loops waiting. duh. do that after dinner.
